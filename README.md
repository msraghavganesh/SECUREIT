The Demo file + Explanation of idea is submitted.

It is the first time that anyone ventured into Hyperledger Fabric as a plateform to solve a Auction problem. 
Hyperledger fabric is a private and permissioned blockchain.

Smart contract is developed using GOlang, and also a detailed documentation  for smart contract and parts of website is provided.
Frontend is built using BEEGo, go framework. (You wont be finding any beego documentation, as we are one among the very few to use golang for frontend)

WE ARE BUILT DIFFERENT XD

A readme file is provided, Set up env for go and beego, then set up your hyperledger fabric environment to run the project locally.

Instructions to run is put up in this repo.

We had an amazing last 24 hours working on this hack, keeping the scalability in mind. We are extremely delighted to complete the hack in time.

IN LIVE DEMO, we will explain the functionalities in detail!
